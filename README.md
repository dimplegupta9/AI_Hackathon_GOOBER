## GOOBER: A Community-Driven Waste Management Solution
GOOBER revolutionizes waste management by connecting local residents with garbage collectors through real-time coordination, similar to ride-sharing platforms. This web-based application allows users to report garbage accumulation in their areas by sending geotagged pictures, ensuring efficient and timely waste collection with AI-powered image validation.

GOOBER addresses inefficiencies in garbage collection systems by leveraging community participation and real-time coordination. Users report garbage issues, and the system alerts the nearest available garbage collector, while admins monitor and oversee the process.

### Problem Statement
Traditional garbage collection methods often lead to delays and inconsistent service. GOOBER solves these issues with a simple platform for reporting garbage and ensuring prompt collection.

### Core Concept
* Users report garbage by uploading images and location data.
* Garbage collectors receive notifications with the location, image, and timestamp for immediate action.
* Admins manage the overall workflow, ensuring timely collections.

### System Architecture
The system consists of three components:

1. **User Frontend**: Where users report garbage.
2. **Garbage Collector Interface**: Receives and manages cleanup requests.
3. **Admin Portal**: Oversees the entire system.
All interfaces are built using the Flask framework and are deployed on Azure App Service, ensuring consistent user experiences.

## Key Features
* Real-time garbage reporting
* Automated assignment to the nearest garbage collector
* AI-powered image validation
* Location-based services
* Admin monitoring and oversight
* Scalable architecture and efficient data handling

## What's Next for GOOBER
1. **Smart Analytics**: Predictive models for proactive waste management.
2. **User Engagement**: Gamification features to drive community involvement.
3. **Collection Optimization**: AI-powered route optimization.
4. **Partnerships**: Collaborating with municipal services and environmental organizations.
**Mobile Apps**: Development of native mobile apps for better user experience.
